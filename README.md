This plugin is temporarily not intended to be used for production-type servers.

Lasted release includes configurations, the ability to create languages, new methods to allow faster processing of bug fix operations, command recoding, and several new commands and arguments to them. Wiki with permissions and commands and arguments will be created soon and in 1.4 or 1.5 update I will try to add tab complete to arguments.
